The JPA cloner project.

The project allows to clone JPA entity sub-graphs. The sub-graphs are defined by string patterns, e.g.:

Project p = JpaCloner.clone(project, "devices.interfaces", "users.privileges");
School s = JpaCloner.clone(school, "teachers.lessonToPupils.(key.class|value.parents)");
Node n = JpaCloner.clone(node, "(children.child)*.(nodeType|attributes.attributeType)");
Company c = JpaCloner.clone(company, "department+.(boss|employees).address.(country|city|street)");

Requirements:
All cloned JPA entities must use the *field* access, NOT property access.
Each JPA entity must have a getter for each property (column, relation, embedded object, embedded collection).
